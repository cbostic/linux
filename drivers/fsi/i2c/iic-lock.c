 * query this handle to determine if the lock was granted.  If the lock
 * count is not zero, the lock has been granted.
 *
 * returns IIC_REQ_QUEUED on success, negative value on failure.
 *
 * Locks from the same client can overlap each other, so a client could
 * lock all addresses on a bus and still request a subset of locks within
 * that range.
 * 
 * Here's the algorithm in a nutshell:
 *
 * Iterate through lock list
 *     -If exact match and same client, stop iterating and increment the
 * 	lock count of the existing lock.
 *     -If partial or exact match but different client, stop iterating and
 *     	queue a new request on the request queue without granting the lock.
 *     -If partial and same client, keep iterating.
 *     -If we reach the end and none of the above apply,
 *       create a new lock and increment the count.
